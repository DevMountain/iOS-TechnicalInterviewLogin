Create an application that initially displays a form with controls to enter a username and password and submit the form. When the form is submitted ensure:
The username is at least 8 characters in length and alphabetic
The password is at least 8 characters in length

Then navigate to another page and display an image and a button to return to the previous screen. 
When tapped, the image should show a message saying “Hello World”. 
If the user returns to the previous screen all information in the form should be cleared.
